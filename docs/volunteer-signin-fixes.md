# Volunteer Sign-In Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes implemented for the volunteer sign-in system to address three key issues:

1. Auto-return after 15 seconds for volunteer sign-in confirmation
2. Red loading spinner color
3. Green outline/glow for signed-in volunteer profile pictures

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Auto-Return After 15 Seconds for Volunteer Sign-In

**Problem**: When a volunteer signed in, the confirmation page did not automatically return to the member list after 15 seconds.

**Solution**: Modified the JavaScript in `assets/js/make-member-sign-in-unified.js`:

- Changed `autoReturnDelay` from 8000ms to 15000ms (15 seconds)
- Updated the volunteer sign-in completion handler to include auto-return functionality
- Previously, volunteer sign-ins were excluded from auto-return, now they follow the same pattern as regular sign-ins

**Files Modified**:

- `assets/js/make-member-sign-in-unified.js` (lines 34, 651-662)

### 2. Red Loading Spinner

**Problem**: The loading spinner was showing in blue (#007cba) instead of the brand red color.

**Solution**: Updated the loading spinner color to match the brand primary color (#be202e):

- Changed the inline style color from `#007cba` to `#be202e` in the `showLoadingState()` function

**Files Modified**:

- `assets/js/make-member-sign-in-unified.js` (line 688)

### 3. Green Outline for Signed-In Volunteers

**Problem**: There was no visual indicator to show which volunteers were currently signed in.

**Solution**: Implemented a green outline/glow effect for profile pictures of volunteers who are currently signed in:

**CSS Changes**:

- Added `.volunteer-signed-in` class to `sass/style.scss`
- Applied green border and box-shadow effect to profile images with this class
- Compiled SCSS to CSS using `npx sass`

**Backend Changes**:

- Modified profile image generation functions to check volunteer status
- Added `volunteer-signed-in` class to profile images when `make_is_user_volunteering()` returns true
- Updated both main profile generation and optimized member search functions

**Files Modified**:

- `sass/style.scss` (lines 147-158)
- `assets/css/style.css` (compiled from SCSS)
- `inc/scripts.php` (lines 545-555)
- `inc/member-search-optimization.php` (lines 180-190, 583-593)

## Technical Implementation Details

### CSS Styling

```scss
img.profile-image {
  // ... existing styles ...

  // Green glow for signed-in volunteers
  &.volunteer-signed-in {
    border: 3px solid #28a745;
    box-shadow: 0 0 15px rgba(40, 167, 69, 0.4);
  }
}
```

### JavaScript Auto-Return Logic

```javascript
// Handle volunteer sign-in vs regular sign-in
if (response.data.status === "volunteer_signin_complete") {
  // Volunteer sign-in - auto-return after 15 seconds
  if (config.enableVolunteerIntegration) {
    $("body").addClass("volunteer-signin-mode");
  }
  setTimeout(function () {
    returnToInterface();
  }, config.autoReturnDelay);
} else {
  // Regular sign-in - auto-return
  setTimeout(function () {
    returnToInterface();
  }, config.autoReturnDelay);
}
```

### PHP Profile Image Class Logic

```php
// Check if user is currently volunteering to add green glow
$profile_image_class = 'profile-image';
if (function_exists('make_is_user_volunteering') && make_is_user_volunteering($user->ID)) {
    $profile_image_class .= ' volunteer-signed-in';
}
```

## Dependencies

The green outline feature depends on:

- `make_is_user_volunteering()` function from the volunteer system
- Active volunteer session tracking
- Proper volunteer database tables

## Performance Improvements

The green outline implementation was optimized to avoid multiple database queries:

- **Before**: Called `make_is_user_volunteering()` for each member individually (N database queries)
- **After**: Single call to `make_get_active_volunteer_sessions()` gets all active sessions upfront (1 database query)
- **Result**: Reduced from N database queries to 1 query for N members, significantly improving performance

The optimized approach:

1. Gets all active volunteer sessions in one database query when the member list loads
2. Creates a lookup array of active volunteer user IDs
3. Passes volunteer status to profile generation functions to avoid individual checks
4. Uses static caching in search optimization functions to prevent repeated queries

## Dynamic Status Updates

To address the issue where volunteer status wasn't updating immediately after sign-out, a dynamic update system was implemented:

### JavaScript Dynamic Updates

- Added `updateVolunteerStatus(userId, isVolunteering)` function to [`assets/js/make-member-sign-in-unified.js`](assets/js/make-member-sign-in-unified.js:742)
- Function finds the specific user's profile card and adds/removes the `volunteer-signed-in` class
- Exposed function globally via `window.MakeSignIn.updateVolunteerStatus`

### Integration Points

- **Volunteer Sign-In**: Automatically adds green outline when volunteer signs in
- **Volunteer Sign-Out**: Immediately removes green outline when volunteer signs out via [`assets/js/volunteer.js`](assets/js/volunteer.js:124)
- **Backend Response**: Modified [`inc/volunteer/volunteer-ajax.php`](inc/volunteer/volunteer-ajax.php:136) to include `user_id` in sign-out response

### Benefits

- **Immediate Visual Feedback**: Green outline appears/disappears instantly without page reload
- **No Performance Impact**: Only updates the specific user's profile image, no database queries
- **Seamless UX**: Users see real-time status changes without waiting for page refresh

## Testing

To test these fixes:

1. **Auto-Return**: Sign in as a volunteer and verify the page returns to member list after 15 seconds
2. **Red Spinner**: Observe loading states during sign-in process - spinner should be red
3. **Green Outline**:
   - Sign in as a volunteer
   - Return to member list
   - Verify the volunteer's profile picture has a green outline/glow
   - Sign out the volunteer and verify the outline disappears

## Browser Compatibility

The CSS effects (box-shadow, border-radius) are supported in all modern browsers. The JavaScript uses standard setTimeout and jQuery methods with broad compatibility.

## Performance Impact

- Minimal performance impact
- CSS effects are hardware-accelerated
- JavaScript changes don't add significant processing overhead
- Database queries for volunteer status are already optimized

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:

- Animated pulse effect for volunteer profiles
- Different colors for different volunteer roles
- Tooltip showing volunteer session duration
- Real-time updates when volunteers sign in/out
